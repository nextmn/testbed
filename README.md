# Testbed
![CI](https://github.com/nextmn/testbed/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

## Getting started
### Dependencies
This testbed has been developped using Debian 12 (Bookworm), but it should also work on all other Linux distributions supported by Docker as long as a Linux kernel is used on the host system (incompatible with Microsoft WSL).

The following Debian's packages are required (or their equivalent on your distribution):
- [`docker-ce`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#install-using-the-repository)
- [`docker-compose-plugin`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-using-the-repository)
- `python3`
- `python3-yaml`
- `j2cli`
- `make`
- `acl`
- `openssl`
- `python3-matplotlib`

>[!NOTE]
> If you intend to use Free5GCâ€™s UPF (with `make set/dataplane/free5gc`),
> install [Free5CG's GTP5G kernel module](https://github.com/free5gc/gtp5g) on your host.
> Please note that you need to have Linux headers installed on the host to be able to install the module
> (for example, the package `linux-headers-amd64` on Debian if you are on an amd64 architecture).

### Usage
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to enable IPv6.
This can be done by adding the following in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:
 ```json
{
	"ipv6": true,
	"fixed-cidr-v6": "fdd4:95c2:f557::/64",
}
```

```text
make build # build
make pull # update docker images
make up # run containers
make down # stop containers
```

The Makefile provides some other commands you might want to use. They are described in [`doc/Commands.md`](https://github.com/nextmn/testbed/wiki/Commands)

#### Configuration
Configuration is done in the file [`default-config.yaml`](./default-config.yaml). Currently, it only contains a list of IP addresses.

#### Documentation
Documentation is available in the [`doc`](./doc) directory.

### Contributing
#### Syntax coloration
To enable syntax coloration in Vim, you can use the following plugin: [`nextmn/vim-yaml-jinja`](https://github.com/nextmn/vim-yaml-jinja).

#### PCAP analysis
To analyse RAN traffic, you can install the following Wireshark/Tshark plugin : [`nextmn/RLS-wireshark-dissector`](https://github.com/nextmn/RLS-wireshark-dissector).

### Known issues
- Docker version `5:25.0.0` has [a bug](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/47120) that prevent running the testbed. Use a different version (`5:25.0.1` or higher, or `5:24.*` or lower).
- To be able to use Free5GC's UPFs along with NextMN-Lite (`make set/dataplane/free5gc && make set/controlplane/nextmn-lite`), you must apply the patch provided in [free5gc/gtp5g#130](https://github.com/free5gc/gtp5g/pull/130) (or you may try to disable GTP Sequence Numbers). If you don't, downlink packets wil be malformed, and thus dropped by NextMN's gNB Lite.
